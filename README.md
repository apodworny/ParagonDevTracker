# Paragon Dev Tracker
Dev Tracker for Paragon, a game from Epic Games. Development ceased when I was told by a developer that he needed to check with other developers if it was okay for me to do this or not. I was told they would get back to me with a list of approved developers I could track, but they never did, even after some pestering. It was at a usable state when development was abandoned in that it tracked and listed activity from one of the developers.
